# ArtifactML Demo

This repository demonstrates the usage of ArtifactML, a new language for structuring applications and documents based on the concept of artifacts and content. ArtifactML is designed to be context-aware, cross-platform, and easily transformed into various output formats.

Special thanks to ChatGPT for assisting in the development and design of ArtifactML and its associated user agents.

## Repository Structure

- `artifacts`: This directory contains ArtifactML examples, including a calculator and a todo app.
- `user-agents`: This directory contains subdirectories for each user agent (HTML, GTK, Conversational, WebXR). Each subdirectory includes an XSLT file that transforms the ArtifactML into the specific output format.

## Getting Started

To try out the ArtifactML demo, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Choose a user agent (HTML, GTK, Conversational, WebXR) and apply the corresponding XSLT transformation to one of the ArtifactML examples in the `artifacts` directory.
3. Run the transformed output with the appropriate platform or tool.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to improve and expand the ArtifactML demo. Please feel free to submit issues or pull requests for any improvements or new user agents you'd like to see added.
